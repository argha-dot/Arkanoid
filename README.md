## Info
---
This project is a simple breakout clone, made for fun and experimentation. As of right now it is in it's early stages, heck it doesn't even have a start menu. Only the core gameplay alongwith an basic health and a bad upgrades systems are implemented as of now. The primary goal moving forward is to learn and add a ton of "juice" to the game, and get better at adding visual effects.

Python and it's Pygame module are used for creating the game.

## Instructions
---
* Control the player pad with mouse, soon WASD support will be added.
* Press Spacebar or LMB to start the game. Should this be mentioned first?

## Future Plans
---
* Add as much as I can from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg) video.

## Final Thoughts

Thanks for reading, to that one person who actually stumbled across this repo.
