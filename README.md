## Info
---
This project is a simple breakout clone, made for fun and experimentation. As of right now it is in it's early stages, heck it doesn't even have a start menu. Only the core gameplay alongwith an basic health and a bad upgrades systems are implemented as of now. The primary goal moving forward is to learn and add a ton of "juice" to the game, and get better at adding visual effects.

Python and it's Pygame module are used for creating the game.

## Instructions
---
* Control the player with mouse, WASD is also support.
* Press Spacebar or LMB to start the game. Should this be mentioned first?
* If you loose all the lives, game over screen will show, press spacebar or return/enter to start a new game.

## Future Plans
---
* Add as much as I can from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg) video.
    * ~~Colors~~
    * Tweening in the beginning (bricks fall into place)
    * Effects when ball hits something :
        * ~~Ball changes color when hit.~~
        * ~~Ball changes size when hit.~~
        * Background color change.
        * Sides bounce when ball bounces off of it.

    * Sound
    * Particles :
        * Smoke when ball hits something.
        * ~~Bricks fall away when hit.~~
        * Paddle particles
        * Ball trail
    * Screen Shake
    * Maybe let's not add eyes and the smiles to everything.
